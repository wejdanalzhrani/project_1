## conclusions/recommendations
1-Riyadh,Eastern and Makkah have a most higher number of traffic accidents and driving licesens.
2-Makkah have the most higher number of casualties dead due traffic accidents.
so,Goverment must take action like applay strong test for driviers and don't forget to be carefull and use seat belts.

I would have additional data like day, month and time of traffic accidents to see what date/time have the most.season could be useful as well.
